    "content": "<p>Dear Experimenter,</p><p> You are about to request to become a FABRIC Project Lead (PL). A PL can create new projects and invite other experimenters into those projects, thus this role comes with substantial new rights and responsibilities. Becoming a PL is not automatic and involves a human-in-the-loop review by FABRIC staff, so it may take up to 72 hours to get processed.</p><p>In general the PL role is reserved for academic faculty or senior staff at US academic institutions, but not for students or temporary staff. Applications from international partners are handled similarly, but may require additional checks and verifications with FABRIC staff. Some exceptions to these rules are possible on a case-by-case basis and will require that another person with administrative standing (e.g. a department head) at your institution vouches for you in writing.</p><p>Press 'Next' to be directed to a CILogon-hosted enrollment workflow. Once you complete your portion of the workflow, FABRIC staff will be notified and will make a decision. The decision will be communicated to you in the form of an email.</p>"

In order for you to begin using FABRIC you must first read and agree to the following Acceptable Use Policy. When you click the 'I Agree' button below, you will be taken to a self-signup CILogon page.</p><p>There you will have the opportunity to select your home institution from the list, which will take you to your institution's login page. You will always use your institutional credentials to login to FABRIC portal via your institution's Identity Provider - we do not and will never store your password or login information. Any password changes that you go through with your institutional account will also affect how you login to FABRIC. If you have MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) enabled on your institutional account, it will also be used when logging in to FABRIC.</p><p>The self-signup workflow you are about to fill out is unattended, it will ask you to verify your personal information and submit it. The workflow will automatically generate an email to your institutional email of record. This email will have a link you must click on in order to complete the process. </p><p>After this process is complete, you can come back to this page and click Login in order to start using FABRIC.</p>"
