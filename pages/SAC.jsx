    "description": "Scott Shenker spent his academic youth studying theoretical physics but soon gave up chaos theory for computer science. Continuing to display a remarkably short attention span, his research over the years has wandered from performance modeling and networking to game theory and economics. Unable to focus on any single topic, his current research projects include software-defined networking, network function virtualization, far memory, edge computing, and Internet architecture. Unable to hold a steady job, he currently splits his time between the UC Berkeley Computer Science Division and the International Computer Science Institute."

He received his PhD from Cornell in 1995. After holding appointments at Caltech and MIT, he joined the UC San Diego faculty in 2003. His research focuses on experimental particle physics and distributed high-throughput computing. His primary physics interests lie in searching for new phenomena at the high energy frontier with the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. His topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the search for dark matter, supersymmetry, and electroweak symmetry breaking. As an experimentalist, he is interested in instrumentation and data analysis. In recent years, this meant developing, deploying, and operating a worldwide distributed computing system for high-throughput computing with large data volumes."

      <p>The FABRIC Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) will help guide the project by providing recommendations and critical feedback. Initially, the focus will be on reviewing the FABRIC design to ensure it can meet the diverse research needs of the future. The committee will also facilitate critical partnerships between collaborating institutions both within and outside of the US. As work progresses, the SAC will develop grand challenges that focus on solving key research problems using the FABRIC infrastructure.</p>
